INITIALIZING STRIPE

I was having this problem in a Vue app not using Laravel.

But to fix it i put the script <script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script> in my index.html

Then when referencing Stripe in a component i used window.Stripe That pointed to the script and fixed the ReferenceError: Stripe is not defined error.
